<br>
<h4>Overview of Projects</h4>
<p>A project is a foundation object in PODD, it sits at the top of the object hierarchy.</p>
<p>Conceptually a project is an abstraction of a real world project, whereby a set of objectives are established, materials are produced, measurements are recorded, observations are made and outcomes are concluded.</p>
<p>A project is not an investigation/experiment, it may contain an investigation, or it may contain thousands of investigations.</p>
<p>Project is a metadata object and not a data object. Data object types may be attached to Project objects.</p>
<p>The Project object will have the following attributes:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>ID * (System Generated)</li>
    <li>Title *</li>
    <li>Description *</li>
    <li>Creator *</li>
    <li>Creation Date *</li>
    <li>Start Date *</li>
    <li>Duration</li>
    <li>Lead Institution *</li>
    <li>Project Status (Active/Inactive/Complete)</li>
    <li>Completion Date (determined by date Project Status is set to complete).</li>
    <li>Publication Status * (Published/Not Published)</li>
    <li>Publication Date * (determined by date publication status is set to published).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Project Status</h4>
<p>A Project status can be active, inactive or complete. It is marked next to the project title on the View Project Object page. The default status is active.</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Active means the project is developing. It is not publicly accessible, but the project members have CRU access to the Project and its objects.</li>
    <li>Inactive means that the project is abandoned. The project and its objects cannot be updated. All project participants will only have read access to the project. Repository wide Administrators will still have CRU access to the project, and thus can revert the status.</li>
    <li>Complete means the project is finished. Accesses will be the same for the Inactive status. The project and its objects cannot be updated. The project status can be reverted if the publication status is Not Published.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a project is complete, the repository administrator or project administrator can publish the project and make it publicly accessible. Therefore, the publication status of a project can be published or not published.</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Published means the Project is complete. Public anonymous users and registered users have complete read access to the project and its objects. Once published the project status cannot be changed.</li>
    <li>Not published means that the project and its objects are only accessible to the people listed as project participants. The project may either be incomplete (active) or complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Active and inactive projects can not be published.</p>

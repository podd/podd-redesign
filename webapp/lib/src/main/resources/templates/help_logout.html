<h3 class="underlined_heading">Log out</h3>
<p>Users should be able to logout when they finish using PODD.</p>
<ul class="stylized">
  <li>If the user is logged in via PODD account, the user clicks the <em>Logout</em> link on the User Functions Menu bar, the session is then expired. The user is redirected to the <strong>Login</strong> page. If the user selects to login via PODD again, they will be challenged for their username/password.</li>
  <li>If the user is logged in via AAF account, the user clicks the <em>Logout</em> link on the User Functions Menu bar, the session is then expired. The user is redirected to the <strong>Login</strong> page. Note that while your PODD session is expired and you are logged out of PODD, your login credentials are retained. This means that if you click to login via the AAF you will not be challenged for your institutional credentials. If it is required to change user then you will have to restart the browser.</li>
</ul>

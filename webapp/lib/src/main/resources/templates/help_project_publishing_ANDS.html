<h3 class="underlined_heading">PIDS and ANDs</h3>
<br>
<p>Once a project is publised, all objects will be registered with the ANDs (Australian National Data  Service) and the PID (Persistent Identifier) Service. The Persistent identifiers are used  to communicate published data.</p>
<p>Each object has a PID field that will be updated when the PIDs are returned  by the ANDS service (See Add/Maintain Persistent URLs).</p>
<p>When all objects are allocated a PID and updated in the system, an email is  auto-generated and sent to the user and the project administrators.</p>
<p>* Note that the term PID generally means Persistent Identifier. However, PID means something else in Fedora-Commons, so from here on in we will use the term Persistent URL or PURL to avoid ambiguation.</p>
<p>The email will advise the users that&nbsp;Persistent URLs (PURLs) have been generated from ANDS for objects in  the published project and the PURL of the project will be provided.</p>

<br>
<h4>Repository User Roles</h4>
<p>A user will have a role that will assist in determining what functions they can perform and what access they will have to existing projects.</p>
<p>There are four distinct categories of users for the PODD website. Each role builds on the privileges of the previous one. They are</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Public users;</li>
    <li>Registered Users;</li>
    <li>Project Creator;</li>
    <li>Repository Administrator.</li>
</ul>

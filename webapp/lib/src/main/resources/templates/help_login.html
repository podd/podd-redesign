<h3 class="underlined_heading">PODD Login</h3>
<p>Registered users of the system need to login to PODD to access their projects and perform functions related to their repository role.</p>
<p>PODD based login is performed using the dialog shown in Figure 4.2.1</p>

<p><em>Figure 4.2.1: Screen shot of PODD Users Login dialog </em></p>
<p>The user fills in:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>User ID;</li>
    <li>Password;</li>
    <li>(Optional) Select the check box next to the statement &ldquo;Remember me on this computer&rdquo;. This means a session is maintained and a user can navigate back to PODD without having to re-establish a connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user is authenticated, a session is created and the user is taken to the "<a href="${baseUrl}/help/project_listing">Project Listing</a> screen.</p>
<p>If either the user name or password is not accepted, an error message will be displayed advising invalid username and / or password. The user can either try the username and password again or contact the system administrator.</p>
<p>If the user is suspended from the system for any reason (i.e. their status is <em>blocked<em>), then the user can&rsquo;t log in and a warning message will be displayed.</p>

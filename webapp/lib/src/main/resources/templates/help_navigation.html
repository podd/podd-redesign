<h3 class="underlined_heading">Website Navigation</h3>
<br>
<p>This section describes the basic look and feel of PODD interface. Please note that because the website is dynamic rather than static, the screen shots provided here may not be completely up to date, i.e. menus and content will change.</p>
<p>Figure 3.1 is an example screen shot of&nbsp; the web based interface of a registered user.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 3.1 &ndash; Screen shot of a logged in user (registered user)</em></p>
<h4>Navigation menu bar</h4>
<p>This menu exists for all users, but varies depending on the userï¿½s repository role. For example: a public anonymous user may only see the tabs: Projects; Browse; and Search. A registered user may see: Projects; Browse; Search; and Clipboard. An administrator may see: Projects; Browse; Search; Clipboard; and Admin.</p>
<p>The Navigation Menu is currently left justified and has a distinct background and border. The development of the Navigation menu is also dynamic and more menu items may need to be added.</p>
<p>When the user has navigated to a menu selected function (e.g. Listing Projects via the Projects menu item) then the menu item will be highlighted (e.g. bolded and different colour).</p>
<h4>Current Function Title</h4>
<p>Displays the title of the current function the user has navigated to.</p>
<h4>Main Interaction Pane</h4>
<p>Primary interaction with PODD functions is through a single pane called the Main Interaction Pane. Some screens may have auxiliary panes as well. All screens will at least have the Main Interaction Pane.</p>
<p>Note that there will be the need for auxiliary panels that will act as menus when in particular functions. An example is for the Admin function. An auxiliary panel will be displayed on the LHS (user perspective) which will list admin functions. The Main Interaction Pane will display contents of the chosen admin function. Therefore the Main Interaction Pane must take up the space available after auxiliary panels are determined.</p>
<h4>Search Box and Link</h4>
<p>The search box and button are for basic searches. The <em>Advanced Search</em> link next to the Search button will allow more comprehensive searches via the Advanced Search screen. These items are visible on screen regardless of the current tab or user's access role.</p>
<h4>User Functions Menu bar</h4>
<p>User functions are listed in this menu bar, such as Settings, Login/Logout, Help, etc. This bar also displays the user&rsquo;s full name. The User Functions Menu Bar is currently right justified, sitting above the Navigation Menu.</p>

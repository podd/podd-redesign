<p>The user is presented with an <strong>Edit Object</strong> screen (See figure 14.3.1). The screen is essentially the same as the second stage of the <strong>Add Child Object</strong> screens, with text boxes filled, of course. All the sections are displayed in an expanding state by default. The user can switch beween the expanding state and callapsing state by clicking the icon next to each section header.</p>

<br>
<h4>Parent Details</h4>
<p>The <strong>Parent Details</strong> section is exactly the same as in the <strong>Object View</strong> Page, with the parent object ID, title, type and relationship displayed in a read only mode.</p>
<br>
<h4>Object Details</h4>
<p>The <strong>Object Details</strong> section displays all the attributes of the object. Figure 14.3.2 shows an example of a Platform object being edited. Object Title and Decription can be modified. Some other fields may be available for editing depending on the type of the object. At the bottom of the Object Details section, Creator, Creation date, Last modified by and Last modification date are displayed in a read only mode (which is not in the Add a Child Object page).</p>

<br>
<h4>RefersTo Tables</h4>
<p>RefersTo Tables can be edited. All the available objects are listed under each RefersTo table. The originally selected object can be de-selected. New object can be added for referencing.</p>
<br>
<h4>File Attachment</h4>
<p>The attached files are listed as in the View Object page. More files can be attached to the object. The procedure is the same as Attach Files in the Create a Project section.</p>
<p>* Note the user cannot edit attached files or information about the attached files in this screen, they would have to select the individual attached files.</p>
<br>
<h4>Action Buttons</h4>
<p>When satisfied with the changes, the user clicks <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
<p>Validation is performed.</p>
<p>If any fields are in error then the user is returned to the top of the page. An error box will appear at top of the page advising there are errors on the page. An error box will appear beneath the fields in error describing the nature of the error and remedial action.</p>
<p>The system confirms the submission to the administrator by switching to the view tab and displaying the object details page in view (read only mode).</p>
<p>If the user clicks the <strong>Cancel </strong>button, the <strong>Edit Object</strong> screen will be abandoned. &nbsp;The screen is returned to the <strong>View Object</strong> page without any change.</p>
<p>The user can also click the <strong>Reset </strong>button to reset the field values back to the origianal value and the screen will remain on the Edit Object page.</p>
<p>If there is another object is being edited by the same user, the user has to click the <strong>ReInitialize</strong> button to edit the object.</p>

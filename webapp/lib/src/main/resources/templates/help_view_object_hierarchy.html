<br>
<h4>Hierarchy</h4>
<p>The project hierarchy is displayed in the Hierarchy section as  current parent, current node and current direct children. Because  Project is the topmost node a parent would not be displayed. For a new  project, then no children would be displayed.</p>
<p>Currently the Hierarchy section is only included in the View Object page.</p>
<p>The Hierarchy section will contain the statement: Hierarchy displays the parent and direct children of the current object.</p>
<p>The <a href="./metadata">Hierarchy</a>  display will be semi-interactive. The user may navigate to an object's  view by clicking on the object title in the hierarchy display.<br />
The Hierarchy will display the current parent object, its Title, Type  and Number of Children. It will not display any nodes above the current  parent.<br />
The Hierarchy will display entries for:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>The current object's Parent Object;</li>
    <li>The current object; and</li>
    <li>The current object's children.</li>
</ul>

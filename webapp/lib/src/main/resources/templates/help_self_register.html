<h3 class="underlined_heading">Self Registration</h3>
<p>This feature is no longer supported in PODD.</p>
<!-- 
<p>A public user can create their own user account on the system.</p>
<p>When navigating to the PODD website, the following screen is displayed (see Figure 4.1.1).</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 4.1.1 &ndash; Screen shot of PODD home page</em></p>
<p>The registrant clicks either of the <em>Login</em> links on the screen, the following screen is displayed (Figure 4.1.2).</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 4.1.2 &ndash; Screen for the user to log on or self register</em></p>
<p>The LHS is the AAF login window, and the RHS is the PODD. In the RHS a <strong>Register</strong> button is displayed on the page for the public user to create an account for themselves. Once the button is hit, a <strong>User Self Registration</strong> screen is returned (Figure 4.1.3).</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>&nbsp;Figure 4.1.3 Sample screen of User Self Registration </em></p>
<p>As shown on Figure 4.1.3, the following procedure is displayed:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>The registrant finishes the account information first, including User name, Email address, Password and Confirm password;</li>
    <li>The status radio buttons are not selectable (default to active) and the Roles radio buttons are not selectable either. The role will default to Repository User and can only be changed by a Repository Administrator;</li>
    <li>The registrant fills in personal information: Title (optional), First name, Last name, Organisation/Institution, phone number, mailing address and url (optional);</li>
    <li>The registrant completes the CAPTCHA test;</li>
    <li>The the registrant clicks the <strong>Create New User</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Validation is performed. An error message will be displayed if any field is in error. Otherwise, the user will receive an email to say they have registered successfully.</p>
<p>If the default status is 'Active' they will be redirected to the login page and a message will be displayed telling them their self registration was successful and they can now log in. (But if the default status is 'Blocked' they will receive a message advising that their login account is currently pending approval by the site support).</p>
<p>Self registered users are created as repository users. By default, a self registered user has no greater access rights than an anonymous user, with the exception that they can provide annotated comments against publicly available projects.</p>
<p>Note that the repository administrator can disable the self-registration function. That way, the Register button shown in Figure 4.1.2 won't be displayed. The repository administrator can also change the default status of a self registered user between blocked and active.</p>

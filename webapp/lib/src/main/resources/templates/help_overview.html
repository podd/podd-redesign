<h4>What is PODD?</h4>
<p>PODD stands for Phenomics Ontology Driven Database. It is a semantic web based online data management system. It supports data lodgment and retrieval either manually via a web based user interface or via internet based automated processes.</p>
<p>PODD is designed to capture, manage, secure, annotate, distribute and publish raw and analyzed data from the phenotyping platforms run by the host institutes, as well as capture sufficient contextual information (metadata) to support data discovery and analysis services.</p>
<p>PODD utilizes Fedora Commons repository software to manage, preserve and link data and metadata. The internal structure of the data and metadata is modeled using OWL/RDFS, a language used for expressing ontologies.</p>
<br>
<h4>Ontology</h4>
<p>An ontology is a common vocabulary about a particular topic, in this case phenomics, and the PODD structure therefore becomes an ontology for phenomics. This approach allows PODD to model multiple phenomics processes without enforcing a rigid data structure. In addition, other community ontologies, such as plant, mammal and gene ontologies, can be used to annotate the data. This not only supports data discovery, but provides common reference points through which PODD managed data can be integrated with data in other research databases, both domestic and international.</p>
<p>PODD organizes the data into projects; at the project level PODD manages data security and allows data publication, meaning data is not available for public access until the relevant project is complete and the data is to be published.</p>
<p>PODD also utilizes Persistent Identifiers to identify published data and provide persistent WWW links to the data, which in turn, can be published in journal articles.</p>

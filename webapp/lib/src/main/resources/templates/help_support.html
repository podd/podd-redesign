<h4>Support Page</h4>
<p>By clicking the &quot;Support&quot; link on the navigation bar, the users can access information on support options, system information and FAQs.</p>
<p>* Note that Support and Help menu options and page access may differ for Public Access users  versus Registered users.</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Public Users may access sections &quot;About PODD&quot;,  &quot;FAQs&quot; and &quot;System Information&quot;.</li>
    <li>Registered Users will access the same  information as Public Users plus &quot;Support Desk&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The support screen display a navigatable sub menu in the LHS (viewers perspective) of the main pane (see Figure 18.2).&nbsp; Each menu will link to a Section.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 18.2 &ndash; Sub menu layout of the Suppport screen</em></p>
<p>The options in this menu is compiled from Sections that the user has access to. The top most menu item is displayed by default. For registered users this is &quot;Support Desk&quot;. For public users this is &quot;About PODD&quot;. The user selects the required support section through this menu.</p>
<p>Support  screens that public users do not have access to will not be accessible (even via  a URL).</p>
<p>Support section information is provided as HTML format files. PODD based screens will not be provided for updating this information.</p>
<br>
<h4>Help screens</h4>
<p>Help screens provide online user documentation on how to use the system.  Help screens will be available based on user access (e.g. A project member will  not see the Project Creation help screen, a public access user will not see the Edit Object help screen).</p>
<p>Help screens will be linked via the Help link in the Primary Navigation menu  and via individual help icons on the PODD screens.</p>

<h3 class="underlined_heading">Managing Data Items</h3>
<br>
<p>Once the Object is submitted, the data files are attached to the PODD object. They can then be listed, viewed, downloaded, edited, or deleted through the <strong>View Object</strong> page.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>&nbsp;Figures 10.3.1.1 &ndash; An example screen shot of the attached data items on the View Object page.</em></p>
<br>
<h4>Listing Attached Files</h4>
<p>As shown in Figure 10.3.1.1, the attached files are listed in the File Attachment section on the View Object Page. They are in order of attachment.</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>The headings: File Name, Size, Type and Format are clickable to change the sort order. Description is not sortable. Description field is limited to the first 160 characters, and wraps around.</li>
    <li>The file name is hyperlinked.</li>
    <li>A check box is displayed in front of each File Name.</li>
    <li>There are two action buttons displayed under the list, Download Selected and Download All.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Downloading Attached Files</h4>
<p>Check boxes next to each file in the list are for the user to select individual files. The user can selcet one or many files, and click on the <strong><i>Download Selected</i> </strong>button to initiate a file download.</p>
<p>If a single file was selected then a normal browser based download would occur. For example if a jpg was selected, the file would be displayed in the browser (with no accompanying html), if a pdf file was selected the browser would allow the user to open the document in word or save the file. In other words, no special handling needs to occur, <strong>except</strong> that the file needs to be downloaded with its original file name (not the Fedora-Commons file name).</p>
<p>If multiple files are selected then the files will be zipped with their original file names and downloaded as a zip file.</p>
<p>There will also be a button for downloading all files called <strong><i>Download All</i></strong>. If there is only one file available, the file will be downloaded as per the single download description above. If there are multiple files, a zip file will be download as per the multiple file download described above.</p>
<br>
<h4>Viewing Data Items</h4>
<p>Individual files can be selected for viewing by clicking on the file name link. The View File Details screen is displayed as follows (Figure 10.3.1.2).</p>
<p class="rtecentre"><img alt="" style="width: 693px; height: 705px" border="1" src="${baseUrl}/resources/images/attachfile5.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rteleft"><em>Figures 10.3.1.2 &ndash; An example screen shot of View Attached File page. </em></p>
<p>The Data Item View is similar to a Child Object view (see <a href="./child_view">Viewing a Child Object</a>).</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>However, since the Data Item does not have a &quot;Parent&quot;, the current object ID, Title and Type are presented instead.</li>
    <li>The Metadata details of the Data Item are then displayed, including Title (File Name), Description, Format, Size, Type, Creator and Upload Date.</li>
    <li>At the bottom of the display are a <strong>Download</strong>* button for users with R access, an <strong>Edit</strong> button for users with CRU access and a <strong>Delete</strong> button for users with CRUD access, and also a <strong>Back </strong>button for user with R access to get back to the <strong>View Object</strong> page..</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;* When Download button is a clicked, a standard download process is initiated as described in this section above: Downloading Attached Files.</p>
<br>
<h4>Editing Data Iitems</h4>
<p>Editing a Data Item means editing the Data Item's metadata; a Data Item's file stream is not directly editable in situ. On the <strong>View File Details</strong> page (Figure 10.3.1.2), click the <strong>Edit</strong> button at the bottom, the <strong>Edit File Details</strong> screen is displayed. It looks similar to the <strong>View File Details</strong> screen.</p>
<p class="rtecentre"><img alt="" style="width: 692px; height: 564px" border="1" src="${baseUrl}/resources/images/attachfile6.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 10.3.1.3 &ndash; Example screen shot of an Edit File Details screen.</em></p>
<p>The current object detais are displayed at the top section in a read only mode. It includes the object Id, Title and Type.</p>
<p>The Metadata details of the Data Item are then displayed, including Title (File Name), Description, Format, Size, Type, Creator and Upload Date. But only the Description is available for editing.</p>
<p>Edit the description in the field, click <strong>Submit</strong> once satisfied. A updated View File Details screen is then displayed with the new file description. If <strong>Cancel</strong> is clicked, the user is returned to the original View File Details screen.</p>
<p>Note that once files are attached they cannot be modified by a Project Member. However, they may replace the file by attaching a file of the same name.</p>
<br>
<h4>Delete Data Items</h4>
<p>Only Project Administrators can delete existing data items. As shown in Figure 10.3.1.2, an <strong>Delete</strong> buttun is displayed at the bottom on the <strong>View File Details</strong> page (only visible to repository administrator and project administrator/ principal investigator).Once Delete is clicked, the following screen is displayed to confirm the deletion (Figure 10.3.1.3).</p>
<p class="rtecentre"><img alt="" style="width: 709px; height: 430px" border="1" src="${baseUrl}/resources/images/attachfile8.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rteleft"><em>Figures 10.3.1.2 &ndash; An example screen shot of View Attached File page.</em>(See Viewing Data Items).</p>
<p>The current object details (ID, Title and Type) and metadata of the file (Title, Description and Size) are listed on the confirmation page. Once the button Delete File at the bottom is selected, the file is deleted and the user is returned to the View Object page with the deleted file removed from the File Attachment section.</p>
<p>If Cancel is selected from the confirmation page, the file will be kept as unchanged and the user is returned to the View Object page.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because Fedora-Commons supports versioning, so a Data Item is not completely deleted, but hidden in the system instead.</p>
<br>
<h4>Handling the Data Item via the Browser Pane</h4>
<p>Data Items can also be accessed via the Browser Pane (see Figure 10.3.1.4). The Data Items are listed under the object which the files are attached to. The File name with format extension and type (Data) are displayed. There are links displayed next to the file: View, Edit and Copy (might be different with different user role and project status).</p>
<p>The link <em>View</em> takes the user to the View File Details page and the <em>Edit</em> link takes the user to the Edit File Detail page. The <em>Copy</em> link allows the user to copy the file to the PODD clipboard. &nbsp;</p>

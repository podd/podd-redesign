        <li>Expected response: Status code 200</li>
        </ul>
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Add PODD Artifact Service</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Load a new artifact (i.e. a PODD object) to the PODD application.</li>

	    <li>Http Method: POST</li>
	    <li>URL: http://&lt;server_path&gt;/artifact/new</li>
	    <li>Parameters: Artifact content in request body. Currently supports RDF/XML only.</li>
	    <li>Expected response: Status code 200. Response body contains the URI of the added artifact</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<h3>Get PODD artifact service</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>Download a copy of the specified PODD artifact (i.e. PODD object) as an RDF file.</li>
		<li>The user must be authenticated to access this service.</li>
    	<li>Http Method: GET</li>
    	<li>URL: http://&lt;server_path&gt;/artifact/[base|inferred]/URI
    	<li>Parameters:</li>
    	<ul>
        	<li>URI - The URI of the artifact to retrieve. The URI should be URL-encoded and the scheme
        	 should be followed by a <code>/</code> character instead of the usual <code>://</code>. 
        	 (E.g. <code>http/example.org/permanenturl/2c8abf88-3036-4ac5-90d5-5e558d142d64/artifact%3A1)</code></li>
        	<li>base - Requests the base (asserted) artifact</li>
        	<li>inferred - Requests the artifact including inferred statements</li>
        </ul>
    	<li>Expected response: Status code 200. Response body containing the artifact</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Edit PODD artifact service</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>Allows editing part of an existing PODD object.</li>
		<li>The user must be authenticated to access this service.</li>
    	<li>Http Method: POST</li>
    	<li>URL: http://&lt;server_path&gt;/artifact/edit/[merge|replace]/URI
    	<li>Parameters:</li>
    	<ul>
        	<li>URI - The URI of the artifact to retrieve. The URI should be URL-encoded and the scheme
        	 should be followed by a <code>/</code> character instead of the usual <code>://</code>. 
        	 (E.g. <code>http/example.org/permanenturl/2c8abf88-3036-4ac5-90d5-5e558d142d64/artifact%3A1)</code></li>
        	<li>merge - Merge with existing artifact</li>
        	<li>replace - Replace any existing statements about these objects</li>
        	<li>The modified RDF statements are sent in the request body. (Currently supports RDF/XML only.)</li>
        </ul>
    	<li>Expected response: Status code 200. Response body containing the edited artifact URI</li>
	    <li>NOTE: The previous version of the artifact is no longer available to users.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Delete PODD artifact service</h3>
	<ul>

   		</ul>
    	<li>Expected response: Status code 200. Response body contains a message with the deleted artifact URI</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<h3>File reference attachment service</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>"This web service makes it possible to attach existing files to a PODD artifact by defining references 
	    to it without having to explicitly upload the files. This is especially useful for very large files 
	    that would take up too much bandwidth if uploaded to PODD directly. This also leaves the responsibility 
	    of file management to the remote data store of the files." - adapted from PODD1.</li>
		<li>The user must be authenticated to access this service.</li>
    	<li>Http Method: POST</li>
    	<li>URL: http://&lt;server_path&gt;/attachref
   		<li>Parameters required to construct a valid file reference vary depending on the type of file reference.
     			For HTTP and SSH file references which are supported at present, the following are expected:</li>
    		<ul>
    			<li>file_reference_type - either SSH or HTTP</li>
		        <li>artifact_uri - The URI of the artifact where the file reference needs to be attached</li>
        		<li>object_uri - The URI of the object within the artifact to which the file reference is to be attached</li>
        		<li>file_server_alias - An alias pointing to more details about the service which hosts this file</li>
        		<li>file_path - The path through which this file can be located on its hosting service</li>
        		<li>file_name - A name identifying the file</li>
        		<li>file_description - A textual description of this file</li>
			</ul>
    	<li>Expected response: Status code 200. Response body contains the file reference's URI</li>
	</ul>
